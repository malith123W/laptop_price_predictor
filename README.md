Laptop Price Predictor
Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications. It combines data analysis, predictive modeling, and a user-friendly web interface to provide instant price predictions based on user-selected laptop features.

The project includes:

A Jupyter Notebook for model building and training

A Flask-based web application for user interaction and deployment

🔍 Model Description
📊 Data Processing
The dataset contains various features, including:

RAM

Weight

Company

Type

Operating System

CPU

GPU

Touchscreen

IPS Display

Data cleaning and feature engineering steps include:

Encoding categorical variables using dummy/indicator variables

Extracting relevant details from CPU and GPU columns

Converting features into a consistent numerical format for modeling

🤖 Model Training
Multiple regression models were evaluated:

Model	R² Score (Test Set)
Linear Regression	~0.70
Lasso Regression	~0.70
Decision Tree Regressor	~0.68
Random Forest Regressor	~0.78

After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.79. The trained model is serialized using pickle for deployment.

🔄 Prediction Pipeline
User input is transformed into a feature vector consistent with the model's training data.

The model predicts a scaled price based on these features.

The output price is formatted and displayed to the user.
